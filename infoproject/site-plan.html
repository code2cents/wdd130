      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>Pornography is just like any other addictive drug, and we can see its influence everywhere,from media to music,and even in our culture.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the largest influence of pornography on people’s lives is the ability to influence expectations regarding sexuality and relationships. A growing number of studies are documenting the negative effects of pornography on relationship quality, satisfaction, and commitment; as well as increasing the likelihood of relationship conflict and breakup..</p>
            <p>Its effects can affect the way we see ourselves, self-esteem, our sexual attitudes and our behaviors.</p>
            <p>Enough evidence has validated the concern surrounding pornography and the ties it has to global issues such as sexual violence and human sex trafficking that it warrants a closer examination of how pornography and these wider societal trends intertwine.</p>

      <h3>[FAQs]</h3>
      <h2>What Exactly Is Porn Addiction?</h2>
            <p>Pornography addiction—along with sex addiction—isn’t an official diagnosis recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM).¹ That means there’s no definitive porn addiction criteria to guide mental health professionals in diagnosing it.</p>
            <h2>What should be my first step to recover from porn addiction?</h2>
            <p>Delete porn from your devices. Here comes the hard part: getting rid of porn. Whatever you have on your phone, computer, or tablet, get rid of it (and that includes bookmarks). The tougher it is to access, the easier it will be to avoid pornography.</p>
            <h2>how can i avoid watching porn?</h2>
            <p>You might notice that you use porn more when you’re stressed, tired, or lonely. Try to pick out what triggers you and makes you want to watch porn, and do your best to avoid these situations. Sometimes, simply acknowledging a triggering situation is enough to break the cycle of addiction.</p>
            <h2>I tried to stop using willpower but i have failed,what else can i do?</h2>
            <p> Talk to a therapist. If trying to break your addiction on your own isn't working out, remember that you can always consult with a professional. Therapists are trained to deal with addiction and can help support you as you break free from pornography.</p>
            <h2>I think I am addicted,how can i find hope?</h2>
            <p>You can find hope that many people tried and were victorious in this journey,you just need to keep a positive mindset and have realistic goals towards recovery.</p>
